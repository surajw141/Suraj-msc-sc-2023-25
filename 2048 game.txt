Yes, developing a 2048 game is definitely solvable using Python! The 2048 game is a popular puzzle game where the objective is to combine tiles with the same number to create larger numbers until reaching the tile with the number 2048. Python is a great choice for developing this game due to its simplicity and powerful libraries.

Here’s a general outline of how you can develop a 2048 game using Python:

### **1. Project Setup**

**Choose Your Development Environment:**
- You can use IDEs like PyCharm, VS Code, or a simple text editor with a terminal.

**Select Libraries:**
- **Pygame**: A popular library for building games with Python, providing tools for rendering graphics and handling user input.
- **Tkinter**: If you prefer a more basic graphical interface, Tkinter is Python’s standard GUI library and can also be used.

### **2. Basic Game Structure**

**Initialize the Game Board:**
- Create a 4x4 grid for the game using a list of lists or a 2D array.

**Game Logic:**
- **Tile Merging:** Implement functions to handle merging tiles when they have the same value.
- **Tile Movement:** Implement functions to handle moving tiles in all four directions (up, down, left, right).
- **Random Tile Generation:** Add new tiles randomly after each move (usually a 2 or 4).

**User Interface (UI):**
- **Rendering:** Use Pygame or Tkinter to draw the grid and tiles on the screen.
- **Input Handling:** Capture user input to move tiles using keyboard or mouse events.

### **3. Game Functions**

**Initialize the Board:**
```python
import random

def initialize_board():
    board = [[0] * 4 for _ in range(4)]
    add_random_tile(board)
    add_random_tile(board)
    return board
```

**Add a Random Tile:**
```python
def add_random_tile(board):
    empty_tiles = [(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4) if board[r][c] == 0]
    if empty_tiles:
        r, c = random.choice(empty_tiles)
        board[r][c] = 2 if random.random() < 0.9 else 4
```

**Merge Tiles:**
```python
def merge_tiles(board, direction):
    # Implement merging logic for the chosen direction
    pass
```

**Move Tiles:**
```python
def move_tiles(board, direction):
    # Implement tile movement logic
    pass
```

**Check for Game Over:**
```python
def is_game_over(board):
    # Check if no moves are possible and return True if game is over
    pass
```

### **4. User Interface**

**Using Pygame:**
```python
import pygame
import sys

pygame.init()

# Set up the display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((400, 400))
pygame.display.set_caption('2048')

def draw_board(board):
    # Implement drawing logic for the game board
    pass

# Main game loop
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        # Handle user input for tile movement
    
    draw_board(board)
    pygame.display.flip()
```

**Using Tkinter:**
```python
import tkinter as tk

class Game2048(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title('2048')
        self.canvas = tk.Canvas(self, width=400, height=400)
        self.canvas.pack()
        self.board = initialize_board()
        self.update_display()
    
    def update_display(self):
        # Implement the drawing logic for Tkinter
        pass

game = Game2048()
game.mainloop()
```

### **5. Testing and Debugging**

- Test different scenarios to ensure all game rules are implemented correctly.
- Debug issues with tile movement, merging, and game-over conditions.

### **6. Enhancements**

- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of the player’s score and display it.
- **Animations:** Add animations for tile movements and merges.
- **High Score:** Implement a high score feature to keep track of the best scores.

### **Conclusion**

Developing a 2048 game in Python is an excellent way to practice programming skills, especially in game development and graphical user interface design. By using libraries like Pygame or Tkinter, you can create an engaging and functional version of the game.
